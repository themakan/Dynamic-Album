			Spring break 2015, the Dullabh and Makan families head to Kona, Hawaii at a resort called Kukio where we are renting a home together.  Divesh leaves on Thursday evening with the girls - the first trip he is taking alone with them.  I join the next morning.  After rushing to pick them up from school, quick snack and ready for the car to the airport, the house is quiet.  An eery quiet.  I get ready for my FEWD class and head out.  The quiet is almost noisly disturbing.  <br>
